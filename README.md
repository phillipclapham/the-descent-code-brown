# The Descent: Code Brown

An ASCII roguelike where you desperately need to reach the bathroom.

## The Premise

You wake up in a dungeon with a CODE BROWN emergency. The only working bathroom is at the bottom floor. Fight through procedurally generated levels, manage your desperation meter, and whatever you do... **don't let the timer run out.**

This is a zero-pressure fun project. Built session-by-session with clear goals.
