## ✅ SESSION 18 - COMPLETE!

**Session 18: Extended Playtesting → Organic Bug Fixes & Missing Features**
**Duration:** ~180 minutes
**Commits:** 4 (eddda90, e56e36c, 95b2b0f, 6e0ef81)
**Files Modified:** 7 files, ~275 lines added
**Status:** ✅ ALL FEATURES WORKING & TESTED

### Work Completed

**🐛 BUG #6 FIXED: Trap Death Detection** (Commit: eddda90)
- **Problem:** Traps reduced health but didn't trigger death (health went negative)
- **Fix:** Changed traps to use takeDamage() method, added diedFromTrap flag
- **Result:** Trap deaths now trigger game over with custom message
- **Message:** "You died from a trap! Should've watched your step..."
- **Files:** player.js (+2), game.js (+13)

**✨ FEATURE: Shrine Altars** (Commits: e56e36c + 6e0ef81)
- **What:** Strategic desperation + HP management via shrine prayer
- **Implementation:**
  * TILE_SHRINE (cyan Ω) and TILE_SHRINE_USED (gray Ω)
  * Spawn at room center in shrine rooms (40% spawn rate)
  * 2-3 consumables around each shrine (Antacid 50%, Donut 30%, Coffee 20%)
  * **R key interaction:** +30 HP AND -30% Desperation
  * One-time use (tracked in usedShrines Set)
  * Visual feedback: Cyan → Gray after use
- **UX Decision:** Switched from E key to R key (no inventory cycling conflicts)
- **Files:** tile-map.js (+23), dungeon-generator.js (+9), game.js (+67)

**🎮 FEATURE: Konami Code Cheat** (Commit: 95b2b0f)
- **What:** Classic cheat code (↑↑↓↓←→←→BA) for playtesting and fun
- **Effects:** HP → 100, Desperation → 0%, reusable
- **Message:** "🎮 CHEAT ACTIVATED! Health and Desperation restored! 🎮"
- **Implementation:**
  * input.js: Sequence tracking, smart reset logic
  * game.js: Activation check in update() loop
- **Files:** input.js (+38), game.js (+12)

### Updated Control Scheme (Session 18)

**NEW CONTROLS:**
- **R key:** Restore at shrine (press R while standing on shrine)
- **Konami Code:** ↑↑↓↓←→←→ Space Enter (hidden Easter egg)

**Full Controls:**
- WASD/Arrows: Move
- Space: Attack
- C: Clench (freeze desperation 10s)
- Q/E: Cycle inventory left/right
- 1-8: Select inventory slot
- X: Drop item
- Enter: Use consumable
- R: Restore at shrine
- H: Help
- M: Mute
- P: Pause

### Key Learnings (Session 18)

- User playtesting reveals critical bugs immediately (invaluable!)
- UX decisions matter: R key better than E for shrines (no conflicts)
- Organic bug discovery leads to extended sessions (good!)
- Know when to stop: Environmental features saved for fresh session
- Session management: Break into subsessions when scope grows

## 🎯 SESSION 18b TASKS (NEXT SESSION)

### Task 1: Implement Environmental Features (45-60 min, 2 commits)

**Current State:**
- TILE_FEATURE exists (blue `*` symbol, value 6)
- Spawned by placeArchitecturalFeatures() in room-shapes.js
- Walkable but NOT interactive (just decorative)

**What's Missing:**
- Interaction system (R key for "read")
- Lore/story text content (10-15 funny/atmospheric messages)
- Track which features have been read (prevent spam)
- Visual feedback (color change after read?)

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Create lore text library (comedy + atmosphere fitting game tone)
   - Office-themed lore (floors 10-8)
   - Maintenance-themed lore (floors 7-5)
   - Sewer-themed lore (floors 4-1)
   - Mix of: world-building, humor, ChromaCorp satire
2. Add TILE_FEATURE_READ state (blue → gray after reading)
3. Add interaction detection (R key when standing on TILE_FEATURE)
4. Track read features (Set of "x,y" coordinates)
5. Display lore text in player message system
6. Visual feedback similar to shrines

**Files to Modify:**
- src/tile-map.js (add TILE_FEATURE_READ constant and rendering)
- src/game.js (add R key interaction for features, lore text library)

**Success Criteria:**
✅ 10-15 lore messages written (funny + atmospheric)
✅ R key reads features when standing on them
✅ Features change blue → gray after reading
✅ Read features tracked (can't re-read same feature)
✅ Lore text displayed in player message

---

### Task 2: Update Help & Tutorial Systems (15-30 min, 1 commit)

**What Needs Updating:**
- Help system (H key): Add R key documentation
  * "R - Restore at shrine (press while standing on altar)"
  * "R - Read environmental features (press while standing on feature)"
  * Maybe add Konami code hint (optional Easter egg reveal)
- Tutorial modal: Update controls list
  * Add R key for shrines/features
  * Mention environmental features as part of gameplay
- Ensure all controls are accurate and current

**Files to Modify:**
- src/help-system.js (update Controls tab, maybe Tips tab)
- src/intro-modal.js (update controls list in intro)

**Success Criteria:**
✅ Help system documents R key (shrines + features)
✅ Tutorial modal mentions environmental features
✅ All controls are accurate and up-to-date
✅ No outdated information
