## Phase 2: Dungeon Generation & Game Identity (CURRENT)

**Status:** Planned, Session 4 ready to execute
**Full Plan:** See `PHASE_2_PLAN.md` for complete details
**Philosophy:** Love letter to roguelikes - get the foundation RIGHT

**Decision:** Phase 2 before Phase 3 because:
- Dungeon generation IS the foundation that makes exploration meaningful
- Great generation makes combat/items SHINE when added
- Room variety, corridors, doors, special rooms = tactical depth
- Better to have excellent generation with no enemies than mediocre generation with enemies

### Session 4: Room Variety & Architectural Features ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Make every room feel unique and interesting
**Duration:** 50 minutes
**Status:** Complete

**Completed Deliverables:**
1. ✅ Room Shape Generator - 6 shapes implemented
2. ✅ Room Categorization - CLOSET → GRAND sizing system
3. ✅ Architectural Features - Pillars and center features
4. ✅ New Tile Types - TILE_PILLAR and TILE_FEATURE

**Files Created:**
- `src/room-shapes.js` (265 lines) - Complete shape system

**Files Modified:**
- `src/tile-map.js` - Added 2 tile types, updated rendering
- `src/dungeon-generator.js` - Shape-based generation, enhanced room objects

**Results:**
- 6 distinct room shapes generating correctly
- Rooms categorized by size with proper distribution
- Pillars blocking movement in large/grand rooms
- Visual variety dramatically improved
- 100% generation success rate
- Performance excellent (<50ms per floor)

### Session 5: Corridor Sophistication & Connectivity ⏳ NEXT

**Goal:** Organic, winding corridors with connectivity
**Status:** Ready to execute

**Key Features:**
- Winding multi-segment corridors (not just L-shapes)
- Nearest neighbor connections (not sequential)
- Loops and alternate routes (25% secondary connections)
- Dead-end alcoves for items
- T-intersections

### Session 6: Doors, Keys & Special Rooms

**Goal:** Doors and special room types
**Status:** Pending (after Session 5)

**Key Features:**
- Door types: open, closed, locked
- Key system (pickup, unlock)
- Special rooms: vault (locked), shrine, arena, library, trap
- 1-2 special rooms per floor

### Session 7: Thematic Depth & Polish

**Goal:** Floor themes and vaults
**Status:** Pending (after Session 6)

**Key Features:**
- 4 floor themes (office → maintenance → sewers → throne room)
- 10+ vault templates (hand-crafted special rooms)
- Environmental hazards (water, chasm, trap)
- Generation quality metrics

### Session 8: Game Identity & Mechanics Design ⭐ CRITICAL

**Goal:** Define what makes this game unique
**Status:** Pending (after Session 7)

**This is a DESIGN session:**
- 50% discussion, 25% documentation, 25% prototyping
- Desperation mechanics deep dive (thresholds, effects)
- Enemy/item concepts (thematically coherent)
- Unique mechanics (signature gameplay)
- Win condition design
- Create `GAME_DESIGN.md` as Phase 3 bible

---

## Current Technical State

**After Session 4:**
- 8 JavaScript files, modular ES6 architecture
- 10-floor dungeon system working
- Desperation meter climbing (not affecting gameplay yet)
- Advanced room-based generation (3-5 rooms, 6 shapes, 5 sizes)
- L-shaped corridors (to be enhanced in Session 5)
- 7 tile types (floor, wall, stairs up/down, toilet, pillar, feature)
- Room variety system with architectural features

**After Phase 2 (Target):**
- 15 tile types (+ pillars, features, doors, keys, hazards)
- 6+ room shapes, 5 room sizes, 5+ special room types
- Organic corridor system with loops
- Door/key mechanics working
- 10+ vault templates
- 4 thematic floor tiers
- Game identity fully documented

---

## Phase 3 Preview (After Phase 2)

**Phase 3 will implement:**
- Enemies using tactical features (cover, doors, chokepoints)
- Combat with desperation modifiers
- Items in vaults and special rooms
- Unique mechanics (Clench, desperation moves)
- Victory sequence with scoring

**Phase 3 will SHINE because Phase 2 built the foundation.**

## Notes

- Phase 2 fully planned (5 sessions, ~6-7 hours)
- Decision: Phase 2 before Phase 3 (foundation matters)
- Session 8 bridges to Phase 3 (game identity)
- Server running on port 8080 for ES6 modules
- Playtesting between sessions drives improvements
- This is a love letter to roguelikes - quality first
