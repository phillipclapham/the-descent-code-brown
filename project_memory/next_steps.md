## ✅ SESSION 16 COMPLETE! (Just Finished)

**Session 16: Tutorial & Help System**
**Duration:** ~60 minutes
**Commit:** a0078ac
**Files Changed:** 5 files (634 insertions, 256 deletions)

### What Was Built

**MAJOR FEATURES:**
1. ✅ **Help Overlay System** - H key toggles comprehensive in-game tutorial
2. ✅ **4 Tabs** - Controls, Mechanics, Strategy, Credits (fully navigable)
3. ✅ **Scrolling** - W/S or ↑/↓ keys to scroll through content
4. ✅ **Tab Navigation** - Arrow keys (←/→) or number keys (1-4)
5. ✅ **Game Pause** - Game pauses while help is active
6. ✅ **Terminal Aesthetic** - Consistent green/cyan styling throughout

**TAB CONTENT:**
- **CONTROLS (38 lines)** - Complete key reference with detailed explanations
  - Movement, combat, inventory management, special abilities, game controls
  - Dual inventory system explained (slots 1-4 weapons, 5-8 consumables)
  - Item dropping mechanics, interaction details

- **MECHANICS (24 lines)** - Core game systems
  - Desperation system and 6 thresholds
  - Clench mechanic (signature feature!)
  - Break Rooms (safe zones where desperation pauses)
  - Desperation abilities (bash walls 75%, force doors 90%)

- **STRATEGY (26 lines)** - Tips for success
  - Desperation management tactics
  - Combat strategies and weapon choices
  - Exploration tips and risk/reward balance

- **CREDITS (24 lines)** - Game information
  - Creator credits (Phill Clapham + Claude Code)
  - Tech stack (vanilla JS, Canvas, ASCII)
  - Roguelike inspirations (NetHack, DCSS, Brogue)

**SCROLLING SYSTEM:**
- Line height: 26px (increased for breathing room)
- Visible lines calculated dynamically based on available height
- Scroll indicators: "↑ More above ↑" / "↓ More below ↓"
- Scroll offset resets when switching tabs
- Smooth scrolling with W/S or arrow keys

**POLISH & UX:**
- Tab height: 40px (increased from 35px for better spacing)
- Perfect text centering (textBaseline = middle)
- Padding: title → tabs (30px) → content (30px) → footer
- Footer shows all controls: "H/ESC: Close | ←/→ or 1-4: Switch tabs | W/S or ↑/↓: Scroll"
- Canvas-based rendering (consistent with game aesthetic)
- Semi-transparent background (rgba(0,0,0,0.85))

**FILES CREATED:**
- `src/help-system.js` (~280 lines) - Complete HelpSystem class with:
  - Tab navigation logic
  - Scroll offset management
  - Dynamic content rendering
  - Scroll indicators
  - Input handling

**FILES MODIFIED:**
- `src/input.js` (+4 lines) - isHelpPressed() method
- `src/game.js` (+45 lines) - Help system integration, input handling, render
- `index.html` (+4 lines) - H key added to controls sidebar

**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**
- Scroll offset per tab (independent scrolling)
- Max scroll calculation (prevents over-scrolling)
- Visible line windowing (only renders what's needed)
- All input properly cleared (prevents repeat triggers)
- Game pauses while help active (no desperation increase)

### Why This Mattered

**Before Session 16:**
- No in-game tutorial
- New players had to discover mechanics through trial/error
- Signature mechanics (Clench, desperation abilities) hidden
- Dual inventory system confusing
- Poor first-time player experience

**After Session 16:**
- Professional in-game help system
- All mechanics explained clearly
- Signature features highlighted
- Strategic depth revealed
- First-time players can succeed
- Portfolio-worthy tutorial presentation

**Impact:** Game went from "playable but confusing" → "fully accessible to new players." Tutorial system is critical for public release. Players can now learn all mechanics without external documentation.

## ✅ SESSION 15 COMPLETE!

**Session 15: Professional HTML/CSS Page Design + Polish**
**Duration:** ~60 minutes
**Commit:** 715a11e
**Files Changed:** 8 files (634 insertions, 187 deletions)

### Highlights

- ✅ Professional page layout (header, sidebar, footer)
- ✅ External CSS stylesheet with design system
- ✅ Controls sidebar visible on page
- ✅ Terminal aesthetic throughout
- ✅ Responsive design (desktop/tablet/mobile)
- ✅ Weapon damage display in messages

**Impact:** Game presentation went from prototype → portfolio-worthy!

## 🎯 NEXT SESSION DECISION POINT! 🤔

**Session 17 (OPTIONAL): Sound Effects**
- Adds audio feedback (combat, items, desperation)
- Enhances experience but NOT critical for release
- ~45-60 minutes
- Can be added post-release

**Session 18 (CRITICAL PATH): Playtesting & Polish**
- Extended playtesting (30+ minute runs)
- Balance tuning, bug hunting, final polish
- ~60-90 minutes
- REQUIRED for public release

**RECOMMENDATION:** Skip Session 17 (sound) and proceed directly to Session 18 (playtesting). Sound can be added in a post-release update if desired.

- Line height increase (26px) dramatically improved readability
- Proper padding creates professional appearance

**Technical Insights:**
- Scroll offset management per tab maintains state
- Visible line windowing improves performance
- Dynamic max scroll calculation prevents edge cases
- Input clearing prevents repeat triggers
- Game pause while help active prevents frustration

**User Feedback Integration:**
- Iterative polish based on user testing (3 rounds)
