## üìã NEXT CONVERSATION START PROTOCOL

**üéØ TO START SESSION 14:**
```
[!read-memory]
"Let's start Session 14: Inventory System Redesign"
```

**Session 14 Focus:**
- Separate weapon/consumable inventories (4 slots each)
- Q/E to cycle weapons, D to drop
- 1-4 direct equip weapons, 5-8 use consumables
- P key to pause game (NEW - essential UX)
- Solves weapon clogging, adds strategic depth

**All Session Details:** See `PHASE_4_PLAN.md` for complete 7-session breakdown

## ‚úÖ SESSION 13 COMPLETE! (Just Finished)

**Session 13: Critical Bug Fixes & Input Enhancement**
**Duration:** ~30 minutes
**Commit:** d679e54

### What Was Fixed

**1. NaN Desperation Bug** ‚ùå‚Üí‚úÖ
- **Problem:** Save/load showed "NaN%" for desperation meter
- **Root Cause:** Missing fallback values when restoring undefined save data
- **Fix:** Added `|| 0` and `|| 100` fallbacks in save-system.js
- **Impact:** Desperation meter now displays correctly after reload

**2. WASD Movement Missing** ‚ùå‚Üí‚úÖ
- **Problem:** Menu said "W/S" but game only supported arrow keys
- **Fix:** Added W/A/S/D support to input.js alongside arrow keys
- **Impact:** Both control schemes work identically in all 8 directions

**3. Menu Controls Text** ‚úÖ
- Updated menu-system.js: "Arrow Keys / W/S" ‚Üí "Arrow Keys / WASD"
- Accurate control scheme display

### Files Modified
- `src/save-system.js` (+8 lines) - Fallback values for safe save/load
- `src/input.js` (+20 lines) - WASD movement support
- `src/menu-system.js` (+1 line) - Updated control text

**Total:** ~29 lines changed across 3 files

### Testing Verified
- ‚úÖ Save/load at 25%, 50%, 75%, 99% desperation - no NaN
- ‚úÖ WASD movement in all 8 directions
- ‚úÖ Arrow keys still work
- ‚úÖ No control conflicts
- ‚úÖ Menu text accurate

### Why This Mattered
These were BLOCKING bugs for public release. Players expect WASD controls (industry standard), and NaN displays look unprofessional. Both critical for launch quality.

**Next:** Session 14 - Inventory System Redesign + Pause (dual system, cycling, dropping, pause key)

### New Items Added to Plan (User Feedback)

**1. Pause Key (P) - Added to Session 14**
- **Why:** Essential UX for roguelike runs (5-30 min) - players need breaks
- **Will it kill suspense?** NO! Standard in roguelikes because:
  - Desperation pauses too (fair gameplay)
  - Can't change game state while paused (no abuse)
  - Adds accessibility without breaking challenge
  - Players can think tactically (part of roguelike strategy)
- **Implementation:** ~15-20 min, straightforward game state toggle

**2. Shrine Interactions (E key) - Added to Session 17**
- **Current State:** Blue `*` symbols (TILE_FEATURE) render but do nothing
- **Original Plan:** Interactive lore/flavor text items
- **Implementation:** E key to read shrine inscription (flavor text about ChromaCorp, The Descent, desperation lore)
- **Priority:** LOW (nice to have polish, not blocking release)
- **Estimate:** ~20-30 min (interaction code + writing 5-10 shrine texts)

## üéØ PHASE 4 PLANNING COMPLETE! ‚úÖ

**Planning Session:** 2025-10-22
**Duration:** ~60 minutes (planning and documentation)
**Deliverable:** `PHASE_4_PLAN.md` (~500 lines, comprehensive session details)

### What Was Planned

**CRITICAL Discovery:** User planning PUBLIC RELEASE with custom domain!

This changed Phase 4 from "optional polish" to "CRITICAL for public launch"

**Issues Discovered:**
1. ‚úÖ **NaN desperation bug** - Save/load shows "NaN%" (CRITICAL) - FIXED Session 13
2. ‚úÖ **W/S keys don't work** - Menu says W/S but game doesn't support WASD (CRITICAL) - FIXED Session 13
3. ‚ùå **Inventory UX confusing** - Weapons clog, can't drop, no cycling (HIGH)
4. ‚ùå **Unprofessional page design** - Title floating above canvas, no structure (CRITICAL)
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è **No tutorial** - First-time players won't understand mechanics (CRITICAL)
6. ‚ùå **No pause key** - Game needs P key to pause (MEDIUM - essential UX)
7. ‚ùå **Shrines do nothing** - Blue * symbols (TILE_FEATURE) have no 'E' interaction or lore (LOW - nice to have)

**Phase 4 Sessions (7 total, 6-7.5 hours):**

**Session 13: Critical Bug Fixes & Input Enhancement** (~30-45 min) - CRITICAL ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Fix NaN desperation on save/load
- ‚úÖ Add WASD movement (alongside arrows)
- ‚úÖ Standardize controls across menu/game

**Session 14: Inventory System Redesign + Pause** (~75-105 min) - HIGH
- Separate weapon/consumable inventories (4 slots each)
- Q/E to cycle weapons, D to drop
- 1-4 direct equip, 5-8 use consumables, ENTER use selected
- **NEW:** P key to pause (freezes game, desperation, effects)
- Solves weapon clogging, adds strategic depth, essential UX

**Session 15: Professional HTML/CSS Page Design** (~45-60 min) - CRITICAL
- Full page redesign (header, sidebar, footer)
- Terminal aesthetic (greens, cyans, blacks)
- Controls visible on page
- Responsive layout
- Credits and tech stack

**Session 16: Tutorial & Help System** (~45-60 min) - CRITICAL
- H key toggles help overlay
- 4 tabs: Controls, Mechanics, Strategy, Credits
- Updated for new inventory/controls
- Explains Clench, desperation thresholds, Break Rooms

**Session 17: Sound Effects & Audio Polish** (~45-60 min) - MEDIUM (optional)
- Web Audio API procedural sounds
- Combat, items, desperation, environment, UI sounds
- M key to mute/unmute
- Retro/arcade aesthetic
- **NEW:** Shrine interactions (E key for lore/flavor text on blue * symbols)

**Session 18: Extended Playtesting & Final Polish** (~60-90 min) - HIGH
- 3-5 complete runs (different playstyles)
- Test all new systems (inventory, controls, tutorial, sound)
- Find and fix bugs
- Balance tuning
- Code cleanup

**Session 19: Public Release Preparation** (~45-60 min) - CRITICAL
- Deploy to GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages
- Custom domain setup
- Public README.md with screenshots
- Meta tags for social sharing
- Cross-browser testing
- Launch!

### Key Design Decisions

**Dual Inventory System (Session 14):**
```
WEAPONS (Q/E to cycle, D to drop)
[1.Plunger*] [2.Wrench] [3.Empty] [4.Empty]

CONSUMABLES (5-8 to use, ENTER for selected)
[5.Coffee*] [6.Antacid] [7.Empty] [8.Empty]

* = Currently selected
```

**Updated Control Scheme:**
- **WASD + Arrows** = Movement
- **SPACE** = Attack
- **Q/E** = Cycle weapon
- **D** = Drop weapon
- **1-4** = Direct equip weapon
- **5-8** = Use consumable
- **ENTER** = Use selected consumable
- **C** = Clench
- **H** = Help
- **M** = Mute
- **ESC** = Pause

**HTML Page Structure:**
- Professional header (title, tagline)
- Centered game container
- Controls sidebar (visible without playing)
- Footer (credits, links, tech stack)
- Responsive design
- Terminal color scheme

### Why This Plan

**User's Goal:** Public release with custom domain - needs professional quality

**Target:** Make both Phill and Claude Code look excellent

**Quality Bar:** Portfolio-worthy, shareable, polished

**Not Optional:** Phase 4 is now CRITICAL for public release success
