## ‚ö†Ô∏è SESSION 18 - IN PROGRESS (Bug Fixes Needed)

**Session 18: Extended Playtesting & Final Polish**
**Duration So Far:** ~90 minutes (code review + bug fixes + initial testing)
**Commits:** 3 critical fixes
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED - 2 new critical bugs discovered during initial playtesting

### Work Completed

**üêõ CRITICAL BUGS FIXED (3):**

1. ‚úÖ **BUG #1: Save/load desperation reset** (Commit: 13d29f1)
   - **Issue:** Every save/load reset player desperation to 0%
   - **Cause:** Wrong property name: `game.desperationMeter.desperation` (undefined)
   - **Fix:** Changed to `game.desperationMeter.value` in save-system.js:42
   - **Impact:** Save/load now correctly preserves desperation percentage

2. ‚úÖ **BUG #2: Desperation persisting across NEW GAME** (Commit: ec0cdde)
   - **Issue:** Starting NEW GAME showed previous game's desperation level
   - **Cause:** Old game loops never stopped, multiple DesperationMeter instances fighting for DOM
   - **Fix:** Added `this.running = false` at 3 death/victory points:
     * game.js:524 - Desperation reaches 100%
     * game.js:708 - Victory (reached toilet)
     * combat.js:181 - Player death in combat
   - **Impact:** Clean game state transitions, no loop leaks

3. ‚úÖ **BUG #3: Game crashing on enemy attack** (Commit: 07a9622)
   - **Issue:** TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'max')
   - **Cause:** Session 17 sound code assumed wrong enemy structure (`enemy.damage.max`)
   - **Reality:** Enemy class uses `enemy.damageMax` (direct property)
   - **Fix:** Changed `enemy.damage.max` ‚Üí `enemy.damageMax` in combat.js:165
   - **Impact:** Game no longer crashes when enemies attack player

**üìù CODE CLEANUP (Commit: 13d29f1):**
- Removed 76 lines of console.log statements from 4 major files:
  * dungeon-generator.js: 37 ‚Üí 0 logs
  * game.js: 20 ‚Üí 0 logs
  * player.js: 19 ‚Üí 13 logs (kept console.warn for debugging)
  * consumable.js: 4 ‚Üí 0 logs
- Kept console.error/console.warn for critical debugging
- ~30 logs remaining in low-priority files (tile-map, desperation-meter, combat)

**üìã PLAYTESTING INFRASTRUCTURE:**
- Created `SESSION_18_PLAYTEST_CHECKLIST.md` (634 lines)
- Comprehensive testing protocol covering:
  * Phase 1: 3 systematic playthroughs (Aggressive, Cautious, Inventory Stress)
  * Phase 2: Edge case validation (save/load, death, victory, boundaries)
  * Performance metrics, balance assessment, UX observations
  * Success criteria checklist

### üö® NEW CRITICAL BUGS DISCOVERED (During Initial Playtesting)

**BUG #4: Combat damage not working** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL - BLOCKS GAMEPLAY
- **Issue:** Player attacks not dealing damage to enemies
- **Impact:** Game unplayable - cannot kill enemies
- **Status:** NOT INVESTIGATED YET
- **Priority:** FIX IMMEDIATELY in Session 18a

**BUG #5: R key (restart) not working** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL - BLOCKS RESTART
- **Issue:** Pressing R after game over/victory does not restart game
- **Impact:** Cannot start new game without page refresh
- **Status:** NOT INVESTIGATED YET
- **Priority:** FIX IMMEDIATELY in Session 18a

**Other Issues Noted:**
- Console warning: "TILE_WEAPON at (28, 24) but no weapon in combat.weapons Map!"
  * Appears to be non-blocking but should investigate
- Console warning: "No upstairs found (Floor 10?), using findWalkablePosition fallback"
  * Expected on Floor 10, but verify spawn safety

### Session 18 Remaining Work

**IMMEDIATE (Session 18a):**
- [ ] Fix BUG #4: Combat damage not working
- [ ] Fix BUG #5: R key restart not working
- [ ] Verify fixes with quick playtest
- [ ] Resume full playtesting protocol

**AFTER BUG FIXES:**
- [ ] Complete 3-5 full playthroughs (Aggressive, Cautious, Inventory Stress, etc.)
- [ ] Document balance observations (desperation rate, Clench, enemies, items)
- [ ] Document UX friction points
- [ ] Performance testing (60fps, memory, console errors)
- [ ] Fix any additional bugs discovered
- [ ] Balance tuning based on playtest data
- [ ] Final code cleanup (~30 remaining console.log statements - optional)
- [ ] Verify all success criteria met

### Files Modified (Session 18)

**Created:**
- `SESSION_18_PLAYTEST_CHECKLIST.md` - Comprehensive testing protocol

**Modified (3 commits):**
- `src/save-system.js` - Fixed desperation property name
- `src/game.js` - Added game loop stopping on death/victory
- `src/combat.js` - Fixed enemy damage property, added loop stopping
- `src/dungeon-generator.js` - Removed 37 console.log statements
- `src/consumable.js` - Removed 4 console.log statements
- `src/player.js` - Removed 6 console.log statements

### Key Learnings

**Bug Discovery:**
- Multiple game loops = DOM control conflicts (desperation meter flickering)
- Sound system errors can crash entire game (typos in property access)
- User playtesting immediately discovered critical bugs (combat, restart)
- Console output is invaluable for debugging async/DOM issues

**Code Cleanup:**
- Keeping console.error/warn for critical debugging is good practice
- Removing informational logs significantly cleans up console
- Comments explaining intent are better than noisy logs

**Session Management:**
- Context window limits require strategic memory updates (~60% usage)
- Breaking into subsessions (18a, 18b) allows focused bug fixing
- Documenting "in progress" state is critical for continuity

## üéØ SESSION 18a FOCUS (NEXT CONVERSATION)

**Goal:** Fix 2 critical bugs blocking playtesting, then resume testing

**Tasks:**
1. Investigate and fix combat damage bug (likely Session 17 sound integration broke damage calculation)
2. Investigate and fix R key restart bug (likely event listener issue after game over)
3. Quick verification playtest (kill enemy, restart game)
4. If fixed ‚Üí Resume full playtesting protocol
5. If more bugs ‚Üí Continue fixing in Session 18b

**Estimated Time:** 30-60 minutes (bug fixes + verification)

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Enemies take damage from player attacks
- [ ] R key restarts game after death/victory
- [ ] No console errors during basic gameplay
- [ ] Ready to proceed with full playtesting
