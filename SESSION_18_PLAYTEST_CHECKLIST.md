# SESSION 18: PLAYTESTING CHECKLIST & DOCUMENTATION

## üêõ BUGS FOUND DURING CODE REVIEW

### BUG #1: CRITICAL - Desperation save/load reset ‚úÖ FIXED
**Issue:** Save system used wrong property name (`.desperation` instead of `.value`)
**Impact:** Every save/load would reset player desperation to 0%
**Fix:** Changed `game.desperationMeter.desperation` ‚Üí `game.desperationMeter.value` in save-system.js:42
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED - Verify during save/load testing

---

## üìã MANUAL PLAYTESTING PROTOCOL

**You must physically play the game to complete this session!**

Open the game in your browser (`python3 -m http.server` then visit `http://localhost:8000`) and work through these tests systematically.

---

## PHASE 1: SYSTEMATIC PLAYTHROUGHS

### RUN #1: AGGRESSIVE PLAYSTYLE (~15-20 min)
**Goal:** Victory via high desperation abilities

**Route:**
- Let desperation climb to 75%+ (don't use Antacids or Break Rooms)
- Test wall bashing (should unlock at 75%, orange-brown walls)
- Test door forcing (should unlock at 90%, bypass keys)
- Use Clench strategically for "clutch" moments
- Engage in combat at high desperation (test rage damage bonus)

**Track:**
- [ ] Wall bashing unlocks at 75% desperation?
- [ ] Door forcing unlocks at 90% desperation?
- [ ] Clench timing - is 10s/60s balanced?
- [ ] High desperation combat - too hard or fun challenge?
- [ ] Screen shake/tint effects - enhance or annoy?
- [ ] Did you die at 100% desperation properly?
- [ ] Victory achievable with this playstyle?

**Document:**
```
Run #1: Aggressive

Outcome: [Victory/Defeat @ Floor X]
Time: [X:XX]
Score: [XXXX] (Rank: [XXXX])
Desperation at End: [X%]

Observations:
- Wall bashing:
- Door forcing:
- Clench timing:
- Balance notes:
- Bugs found:
```

---

### RUN #2: CAUTIOUS PLAYSTYLE (~20-25 min)
**Goal:** Victory via low desperation, thorough exploration

**Route:**
- Find all keys, open locked doors normally
- Use Break Rooms (floors 8-3, 25% spawn chance)
- Pick up Antacids, maintain <50% desperation
- Explore thoroughly, find vaults
- Use Coffee for speed, Energy Drink for invincibility

**Track:**
- [ ] Break Room spawn rate - too rare/common/good? (25%)
- [ ] Break Room desperation pause - works correctly?
- [ ] Antacid effectiveness - reduces 25%, spawn rate good?
- [ ] Low desperation combat - accuracy/damage feel right?
- [ ] Consumable spawn rate - 2-3 per floor adequate?
- [ ] Exploration rewarding? (vaults, special rooms)
- [ ] Victory achievable with this playstyle?

**Document:**
```
Run #2: Cautious

Outcome: [Victory/Defeat @ Floor X]
Time: [X:XX]
Score: [XXXX] (Rank: [XXXX])
Desperation at End: [X%]

Break Rooms Found: [X]
Antacids Used: [X]
Keys Collected: [X]

Observations:
- Break Room frequency:
- Desperation management:
- Consumable availability:
- Balance notes:
- Bugs found:
```

### RUN #3: INVENTORY STRESS TEST (~15-20 min)
**Goal:** Test inventory system edge cases

**Actions to Test:**

- [ ] Fill all 8 slots (4 weapons + 4 consumables)
- [ ] Direct select slots 1-8 (number keys)
- [ ] Cycle to consumable slot (5-8), press ENTER to use
- [ ] Drop consumable (X key from consumable slot)
- [ ] Use consumable during active Coffee effect (stacking?)
- [ ] Save with full inventory ‚Üí Close ‚Üí Load ‚Üí Verify all items restored

**Track:**
- [ ] Visual clarity - which slot selected obvious?
- [ ] Cycling smooth - no stuttering or skipped slots?
- [ ] Drop spawns correctly - no out of bounds?
- [ ] Full inventory message clear?
- [ ] Weapon auto-equip on pickup (if no weapon equipped)?
- [ ] Consumable "press ENTER" message shows?
- [ ] Save/load preserves all 8 slots correctly?

**Document:**
```
Run #3: Inventory Stress

Bugs Found:
1. [Description] - Severity: [CRITICAL/HIGH/MED/LOW]

UX Observations:
- Visual clarity:

- [ ] Worth seeking out?
- [ ] Too rare? Too common?

**Enemy Difficulty**
- [ ] Completable with practice (50%+ win rate)?
- [ ] Difficulty curve smooth (Floor 10‚Üí1)?
- [ ] Any enemies too hard/easy?
